## Background

I'm a product-minded individual passionate about building technology that genuinely improves people's lives. I believe the best products come from deeply understanding human problems and crafting elegant solutions that feel natural to use.

My journey into product management started with a simple observation: the tools we use every day often make things harder, not easier. I became fascinated with why some products feel intuitive while others feel like a struggle. This curiosity drives me to explore the intersection of technology, design, and human psychology.

**Interests**

Outside of building products, I'm deeply interested in understanding what makes relationships work. Whether it's personal connections or professional collaborations, I believe strong relationships are the foundation of everything meaningful. I also enjoy exploring how technology can help us be more intentional about the things that truly matter.

### What's Next

I'm seeking opportunities to work on products that make a real difference in people's lives. I'm particularly interested in roles where I can combine customer empathy with technical understanding to ship products that users love. Whether it's at an early-stage startup or within an innovation team at a larger company, I want to be where meaningful problems are being solved.
