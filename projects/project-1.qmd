## Overview

Keep Up is a simple but powerful app designed to help you stay connected with the people who matter most. In our busy lives, it's easy to let important relationships fade - not because we don't care, but because we forget to reach out.

The primary purpose of this app is to:

- **Track relationships**: Add the people you want to stay in touch with and set how often you'd like to reach out
- **Never forget commitments**: Log promises and commitments you make to people so you can follow through
- **Visual reminders**: Instantly see who you're overdue to contact with color-coded status indicators

## The Problem

I built Keep Up to solve a problem I personally experience: I make commitments to people but often fail to follow through. I also find myself losing touch with good friends simply because I get busy with other life things. It's not that I don't value these relationships - I just need a system to help me be more intentional about nurturing them.

## Technical Details

**Framework/Stack**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Data Storage**: Browser localStorage (your data stays private on your device)

**Deployment**: Vercel

**Tools Used**:

- Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Vercel for deployment

## Key Features

### People Tracking
Add friends, family, colleagues, or anyone you want to stay connected with. Set a frequency for how often you'd like to reach out (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly). The app calculates when you're overdue and shows you at a glance who needs attention.

### Commitment Tracking
When you tell someone "I'll send you that article" or "Let's grab coffee next week," you can log it as a commitment. The app tracks due dates and helps you keep your word.

### Privacy-First Design
All data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. Nothing is sent to a server, so your relationship data stays completely private.

## What I Learned

Building this app taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **Start with the problem**: I built something I actually needed, which made every decision clearer
2. **Keep it simple**: A focused solution beats a feature-bloated one
3. **AI-assisted development**: Claude Code dramatically accelerated my ability to go from idea to working product
4. **Ship and iterate**: Getting something live quickly creates momentum for improvement
