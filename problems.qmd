title: "Problems I'm Exploring"
---

As a product thinker, I'm constantly observing the friction points in everyday life. These are five problems I personally experience that I believe are worth solving. Each represents an opportunity to create something meaningful.

## 1. Losing Touch with People I Care About

**The Problem**: Despite having the best intentions, I regularly lose touch with friends and family members I genuinely care about. It's not that I don't value these relationships - it's that life gets busy, and without a system, weeks turn into months turn into years of silence.

**Why This Matters to Me**: Relationships are the foundation of a meaningful life. When I think about my happiest moments, they almost always involve the people I love. Yet I consistently fail to prioritize reaching out, and I watch valuable connections slowly fade. The cost isn't just social - it's emotional. There's a quiet guilt that comes from knowing you've let someone down by simply forgetting about them.

**What a Solution Might Look Like**: A simple system that helps me be intentional about staying connected - not through automation or impersonal messages, but by gently reminding me when it's time to reach out to someone who matters.

## 2. Breaking Commitments Without Realizing It

**The Problem**: I tell people "I'll send you that link" or "Let's definitely get lunch next week" with complete sincerity in the moment. Then life happens, I forget, and I've broken a small promise. These micro-betrayals add up and erode trust over time.

**Why This Matters to Me**: Your word is your reputation. Every time I fail to follow through - even on small things - I'm telling the other person that they weren't important enough to remember. I want to be someone people can count on, but my current system (which is basically just hoping I remember) isn't working.

**What a Solution Might Look Like**: A lightweight way to capture commitments in the moment and surface them before they become overdue. Not a full task manager - just a simple promise tracker.

## 3. Information Overload Leading to Shallow Understanding

**The Problem**: I consume enormous amounts of content - articles, podcasts, videos, books - but retain very little of it. I read something interesting, feel momentarily enlightened, and then completely forget it two days later. All that time invested, minimal lasting value extracted.

**Why This Matters to Me**: Learning should compound over time. Instead, I feel like I'm on a treadmill - constantly consuming but never actually building knowledge. The most successful people I admire seem to have deep, interconnected understanding of their domains. I have a collection of half-remembered factoids.

**What a Solution Might Look Like**: A system that helps me actively process what I consume - perhaps through forced reflection, spaced repetition, or connections to existing knowledge. Something that transforms passive consumption into active learning.

## 4. Difficulty Maintaining Healthy Habits During Disruptions

**The Problem**: I can maintain good habits (exercise, healthy eating, meditation) when life is routine. But the moment there's a disruption - travel, a busy work period, a family event - my habits completely collapse. Then I have to rebuild from scratch, which gets harder each time.

**Why This Matters to Me**: Health and wellbeing are foundational. Without energy and clarity, everything else suffers. Yet my habits are fragile, dependent on perfect conditions that rarely exist in real life. I need a way to maintain momentum even when circumstances aren't ideal.

**What a Solution Might Look Like**: A habit system that acknowledges imperfection and helps you maintain "minimum viable habits" during disrupted periods, rather than the all-or-nothing approach most apps take.

## 5. Spending Money Without Alignment to Values

**The Problem**: At the end of each month, I look at my spending and wonder where it all went. Individually, each purchase seemed reasonable. Collectively, they don't reflect what I actually value. I'm not broke, but I'm not intentional either.

**Why This Matters to Me**: Money is stored time and energy. How I spend it should reflect what matters most to me. Yet the friction of tracking and categorizing spending is so high that I avoid it entirely. I know roughly what I value, but I have no idea if my spending reflects those values.

**What a Solution Might Look Like**: A way to see spending through the lens of personal values rather than traditional budget categories. Not "you spent $400 on food" but "here's how much you invested in experiences with friends vs. solo convenience purchases."

## Why I Share These Problems

I believe the best products come from founders who are solving their own problems. These aren't abstract market opportunities - they're genuine friction points in my life. By sharing them publicly, I'm inviting conversation, collaboration, and accountability to actually work on solutions.

If any of these resonate with you, I'd love to hear your perspective.
